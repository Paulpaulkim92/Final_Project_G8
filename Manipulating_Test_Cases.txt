Manipulating    Typical Case    Input: "Hello", "World"    Expected Output: "HelloWorld"
Manipulating    Minimal Edge Case    Input: "q"    Expected Output: Program should quit.
Manipulating    Maximal Edge Case    Input: "A string of size _BUFFER_SIZE - 1 (which is 80 characters for _BUFFER_SIZE = 80), and another string of size 1 character (such as "A")."
                                        Expected Output: The concatenated string should be exactly _BUFFER_SIZE characters long (80 characters in this case), without causing any overflow or truncation.
Manipulating    Input with Exceeding Buffer Size    Input: "Strings that would exceed _BUFFER_SIZE."
                                        Expected Output: Should either throw an error or handle properly with truncation.
Manipulating    Multiple Spaces Between Words    Input: "Hello    ", "   World"    Expected Output: "Hello   World"
Manipulating    Empty Strings Multiple Times    Input: "", "", ""    Expected Output: ""
Manipulating    Concatenation with Non-ASCII Characters (Unicode)    Input: "Hello", "ðŸ˜Š"    Expected Output: "HelloðŸ˜Š"
Manipulating    Invalid Characters    Input: 
        First string: "Hello\n" (string with a newline character).
        Second string: "World!" (valid string).
        Expected Output: The program should either remove or handle the newline character correctly, concatenating the strings to form "Hello                           World!".
